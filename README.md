This is a simple project where I try to make a character move in 2D space and to avoid enemies.

I'm using this project to understand and use some c programming, freeglut(OpenGL), and some other random things such as the fast inverse square root from Quake Engine, etc.

I also using this project to understand how to architect a program structure, so that it can be fast, small, compact, and portable.
